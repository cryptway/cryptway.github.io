                <p><b>2.1 Literature Survey</b></p><br>

                <p><strong>2.1.1 Crypto exchanges:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A&nbsp;cryptocurrency exchange, or a&nbsp;digital currency exchange&nbsp;(DCE), is a business that allows customers to trade&nbsp;cryptocurrencies&nbsp;or&nbsp;digital currencies&nbsp;for other assets, such as conventional&nbsp;fiat money&nbsp;or other digital currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies or cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency exchange can be a&nbsp;market maker&nbsp;that typically takes the&nbsp;bid&ndash;ask spreads&nbsp;as a transaction commission for is service or, as a matching platform, simply charges fees.</p>

<p>Some brokerages which also focus on other assets such as stocks, like&nbsp;Robinhood&nbsp;and&nbsp;eToro, let users purchase but not withdraw cryptocurrencies to&nbsp;cryptocurrency wallets. Dedicated cryptocurrency exchanges such as&nbsp;Binance&nbsp;and&nbsp;Coinbase&nbsp;do allow cryptocurrency withdrawals, however.</p>

<p>The exchanges can send cryptocurrency to a user&#39;s personal&nbsp;cryptocurrency wallet. Some can convert digital currency balances into anonymous prepaid cards which can be used to withdraw funds from&nbsp;ATMs&nbsp;worldwide<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-ndic2008-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-sood2013-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;while other digital currencies are backed by real-world commodities such as gold.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-ByrnesMunro2013-3">[3]</a></p>

<p>The creators of digital currencies are often independent of the digital currency exchange that facilitate trading in the currency.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-sood2013-2">[2]</a>&nbsp;In one type of system, digital currency providers (DCP) are businesses that keep and administer accounts for their customers, but generally do not issue digital currency to those customers directly.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-secp-4">[4]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-Hesterman2013-5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Customers buy or sell digital currency from digital currency exchanges, who transfer the digital currency into or out of the customer&#39;s DCP account.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-Hesterman2013-5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Some exchanges are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally independent businesses.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-secp-4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts may be of a real or fictitious currency.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-Hesterman2013-5">[5]</a></p>

<p>A digital currency exchange can be a brick-and-mortar business or a strictly online business. As a brick-and-mortar business, it exchanges traditional payment methods and digital currencies. As an online business, it exchanges electronically transferred money and digital currencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Often, the digital currency exchanges operate outside the Western countries to avoid regulation and prosecution. However, they do handle Western fiat currencies and maintain bank accounts in several countries to facilitate deposits in various national currencies.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-ndic2008-1">[1]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange#cite_note-sood2013-2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Decentralized exchanges&nbsp;such as Etherdelta, IDEX and HADAX do not store users&#39; funds on the exchange, but instead facilitate&nbsp;peer-to-peer&nbsp;cryptocurrency trading. Decentralized exchanges are resistant to&nbsp;security problems&nbsp;that affect other exchanges.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.2 Popularity and issues:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>From <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14110516">[1]</a> One of the most popular ways to trade and hold cryptocurrencies is by using crypto exchanges. Moore and Christin (2013) were the first to notice that traders can face the risk of crypto exchange closing down with accounts wiped out. They showed that nearly 45 percent of exchanges that opened before 2013 failed, taking the users&rsquo; money with them. This result shows the need to develop models that can discriminate between safe and vulnerable exchanges. This goal is important because crypto exchanges are the most popular way to exchange fiat currencies with cryptocurrencies and vice versa, and it is therefore essential to know which exchange to use based on its security and safety profiles. Moreover, the risks of crypto exchanges may significantly contribute to the value of cryptocurrencies as assets, as the famous bankruptcy of the Mt. Gox exchange and the hacks of several exchanges highlighted, see Feder et al. (2017), Gandal et al. (2018), Chen et al. (2019), Twomey and Mann (2020), and Alexander and Heck (2020) for a detailed discussion.[16]</p>

<p>It allows a buyer to deposit money using several methods like direct bank transfer, UPI, using debit or credit cards, etc. It charges a set commission or fee for every transaction done using its services. Depending on the exchange, one can purchase crypto using a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or trade one form of crypto for another, for example converting Bitcoin to Litecoin. Trader may be able to convert their crypto back into regular currency, leave it in their account for future trades, or withdraw it as cash. Available services can vary, depending on the exchange that is used. For example, some services don&rsquo;t allow traders to move their crypto off platform to their own crypto wallet. Unlike traditional exchanges that have set trading hours, cryptocurrency exchanges are active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.3 Centralized exchanges:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) act as an intermediary between a buyer and a seller and make money through commissions and transaction fees. You can imagine a CEX to be similar to a stock exchange but for digital assets.</p>

<p>Popular Crypto Exchanges are Coinbase, Crypto.com, Gemini, and Binance. Much like stock trading websites or apps, these exchanges allow cryptocurrency investors to buy and sell digital assets at the prevailing price, called spot, or to leave orders that get executed when the asset gets to the investor&rsquo;s desired price target, called limit orders.</p>

<p>CEXs operate using an order book system, which means that buy and sell orders are listed and sorted by the intended buy or sell price. The matching engine of the exchange then matches buyers and sellers based on the best executable price given the desired lot size. Hence, a digital asset&rsquo;s price will depend on the supply and demand of that asset versus another, whether it be fiat currency or cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>CEXs decide which digital asset it will allow trading in, which provides a small measure of comfort that unscrupulous digital assets may be excluded from the CEX.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.4 Hacking risk</strong></p>

<p>Centralized exchanges are operated by companies that are responsible for the holdings of their customers. Large exchanges usually hold billions of dollars&rsquo; worth of bitcoin, making them a target for hackers and theft.</p>

<p>An example of such an incident is Mt. Gox, which was once the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange company before it reported the theft of 850,000 bitcoins, leading to its collapse.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.5 Transaction fees</strong></p>

<p>Unlike peer-to-peer transactions, centralized exchanges often charge high transaction fees for their services and convenience, which can be especially high when trading in large amounts.</p>

<p><strong>2.1.6 Custody of digital assets</strong></p>

<p>Lastly and most importantly, most CEXs will hold your digital asset as a custodian in their own digital wallet rather than allow you to store your private keys on your own digital wallet. While more convenient when you want to trade, there are drawbacks, namely the risk of the centralized cryptocurrency exchange failing and fraud.</p>

<p>Centralised platforms like Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood are considered to be the gateway into crypto for multitude of people, but these apps have a tight hold over who can and cannot access their systems and can clearly revoke access to all the consumers who they deem harmful or misusing the platform. The data in these companies is stored in a centralised location which means it is much more susceptible to hacking and other vulnerabilities like external manipulation. Meanwhile, decentralised platforms are much more secure and have multiple layers of anonymity, this makes them a haven for unregulated transactions, whether good or bad. This is because of smart contracts which are computer generated transaction protocols enabling said transactions.<a href="https://grm.institute/blog/research-study-on-cryptocurrency-exchange-platform/">[5]</a></p>

<p><strong>2.1.7 Potential:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As given by N. Gowda and&nbsp; C. Chakravorty <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666285X21000923">[6]</a>, Cryptocurrency has the capability to carry the banking industry worldwide with robust security, thereby increasing trade efficiency and replacing manual and paper-based processes with streamlined and automated ones. Also, a public blockchain is an excellent collaboration tool.</p>

<p>This leads us to the need for development of a system where the risks are minimised and the manipulation can be stopped at the personal level itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>2.2 Limitations of existing systems:</strong></h3>

<p>The concept of centralization refers to the use of a middle man or a third party to assist within transactions in a secure manner. Both buyers and sellers trust the middle man to handle their properties. The centralized exchanges require their users to verify their personal information before using the tools provided by them. The levels of verification may vary from exchange to exchange. These KYC checks are in order to ensure that crypto businesses comply with anti-money laundering measures. Approximately 99% of all crypto transactions go through centralized exchanges.</p>

<p>These Central platforms are increasingly easy to use and act as a gateway into Crypto investments for a majority of people. The services then levy their fees and taxes on the new user. The user then has to continue using the services since they cannot withdraw their investments from certain applications. This leads to less freedom of investments and an overall worse crypto economy leading to further losses. Since the resources of an investor are compiled in a single location in the central exchange, malware attacks or hacking attempts are rampant.</p>

<p>While more convenient when you want to trade, there are drawbacks, namely the risk of the centralised cryptocurrency exchange failing and fraud.<a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/cryptocurrency/cryptocurrency-exchanges/">[7]</a>Also the exchanges have complete monopoly over the digital wallet of the consumer and can be confiscated and transactions can be stopped for any reasons whatsoever since complete control is in the exchanges hand <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-restricts-crypto-trading-as-bitcoin-dogecoin-surge.html">[8]</a>. Meanwhile the decentralised crypto exchanges have advanced security and use smart contracts to facilitate transactions keeping the P2P transactions safe and anonymous.</p>
