                <p>3.1 Cryptway is the answer to the above stated problems, we use smart contracts to facilitate transactions. A&nbsp;smart contract&nbsp;is a&nbsp;computer program&nbsp;or a&nbsp;transaction protocol&nbsp;that is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally-relevant events and actions according to the terms of a&nbsp;contract&nbsp;or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need for trusted intermediators, arbitration costs, and fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions.&nbsp;Smart contracts are commonly associated with&nbsp;cryptocurrencies, and the smart contracts introduced by&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;are generally considered a fundamental building block for&nbsp;decentralized finance&nbsp;(DeFi) and&nbsp;NFT&nbsp;applications.</p>

<p>Vending machines&nbsp;are mentioned as the oldest piece of technology equivalent to smart contract implementation.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract#cite_note-savel-3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The original&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;white paper&nbsp;by&nbsp;Vitalik Buterin&nbsp;in 2014&nbsp;describes the&nbsp;Bitcoin protocol&nbsp;as a weak version of the smart contract concept as originally defined by&nbsp;Nick Szabo, and proposes a stronger version based on the&nbsp;Solidity&nbsp;language, which is&nbsp;Turing complete. Since Bitcoin, various cryptocurrencies support&nbsp;scripting languages&nbsp;which allow for more advanced smart contracts between untrusted parties.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract#cite_note-10">[10]</a></p>

<p>A clean UI and integrated news and documentation to fulfil our objectives of creating awareness about cryptocurrency and enabling successful investments.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.2 Decentralised exchange:&nbsp;</p>

<p>DEX&rsquo;s act as a platform where individuals can buy and sell assets from one another.</p>

<p>Unlike Centralised Exchanges (CEX&rsquo;s), they don&rsquo;t provide custody or settlement services, nor do they require account opening or AML/KYC&nbsp;processes.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rhuvQxlyVPSSBYdxKASQQfN9vXiN1Rt-PAlLphb_Y_8J0LBL4Ust-bTBbfY8IvHERQSs_3w-BYOH5PaFXzr6AmATDwOwAZU6Ecfac_ugqhvTTjWtJTIJqncmS7FSHDM_rIkRa_YO2biDRIeU5gR3_39dJBVKazrdXXdrfFWMOVVOrA7GsXr2BOawpXL8Rh8v5HIjbQE52A" style="height:334px; width:594px" /></p>

<p>Figure 1 :-&nbsp; Centralized and Decentralized framework</p>

<p>This is due to the user themselves providing all of the ancillary services provided by capital markets &ndash; beyond simply matching and execution.</p>

<p>The user themselves never relinquishes control of their assets to a separate entity, until the point at which they transact, taking away counterparty risk and making DEX&rsquo;s trustless (where one does not have to place trust in an intermediary, but only in the smart contract which facilitates execution).</p>

<p>Trades are matched and executed using smart contracts, which ensure that securities are always exchanged at their agreed upon price.</p>

<p>They are completely transparent, but also anonymous, in that one can see the addresses of all executed transactions, without revealing the identity of the person/s behind this address.</p>

<p>They are owned and operated entirely by the user, where control over updates to the respective protocols can be proposed by anyone, and are voted on by governance token holders.</p>

<p>These governance token holders have limited control over what changes can be made to the protocol, however given there is no counterparty risk (no custody), any impact from a detrimental change in code is confined to the governance token holders (given the value of the exchange would fall). Switching costs are next to 0, so users could simply pack up shop and move on should the change be disadvantageous to themselves.</p>

<p>There is no requirement for expensive management, development, or administration teams, given the pure simplicity of their function &ndash; providing a platform where users can buy/sell assets to one another, nothing more and nothing less.</p>

<p>Given the decentralised ownership structure, regulators have had a hard time on figuring out who to target &ndash; there is no single owner/operator to fine, and given the underlying code is open source, front end platforms can appear anywhere on the internet. <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/QJg9HSrvc2409frfyZghwBXvlAxkdgCN5uvvD2gMSgZ6j2BaeB8gJVasIOFcrcUKXGQJXq5TOblXOe5hk2YhJTXnY7baGuYP05V7F45zjI_yPlUU7ST576nie9Zi6ILGyPrQRLlqma6ruI6RqtorQbDjHVk595wOjhJUC0DKj_fqTp7Sb6PeRHSsoKvwA7hKRc6-aUxysg" style="height:417px; width:594px" /></p>

<p>3.2.1 Uniswap:&nbsp;</p>

<p>An Uniswap like system is also going to be implemented in the project. An Uniswap like application is also created using said resources. The Uniswap protocol is a peer-to-peer<a href="https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/introduction#fn-1">[3]</a>&nbsp;system designed for exchanging cryptocurrencies&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">(ERC-20 Tokens)</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/">Ethereum</a>&nbsp;blockchain. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts; designed to prioritize censorship resistance, security, self-custody, and to function without any trusted intermediaries who may selectively restrict access.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/HhPV0CBi6-V5moqfkkaa5jGZlJn0u__fINOon7o-YoBqxs2N6C66r0cd0uah1djqSHWnrbJ_v62n2ET9W-tQKaXJRcG8fcuCaEBbnYQAoEPeE_PYduLZEE1M8DOFaQiBioonuSB2U7mqGmLlyo1ns89vjklqOOf2us_rHhSjP5IqIkZyJ8QwsIK9Hu04hgdza0c6Tk4JFA" style="height:446px; width:594px" /></p>

<p>Figure 3: Working Graph Model</p>

<p>There are currently three versions of the Uniswap protocol. V1 and V2 are open source and licensed under GPL. V3 is open source with slight modifications. Each version of Uniswap, once deployed, will function in perpetuity, with 100% uptime, provided the continued existence of the Ethereum blockchain. Swaps are the most common way of interacting with the Uniswap protocol. For end-users, swapping is straightforward: a user selects an ERC-20 token that they own and a token they would like to trade it for. Executing a swap sells the currently owned tokens for the proportional amount of the tokens desired, minus the swap fee, which is awarded to liquidity providers. Swapping with the Uniswap protocol is a permissionless process.</p>

<p>3.2.2 Uniswap Protocol:&nbsp;</p>

<p>To understand how the Uniswap protocol differs from a traditional exchange, it is helpful to first look at two subjects: how the Automated Market Maker design deviates from traditional central limit order book-based exchanges, and how permissionless systems depart from conventional permissioned systems. Most publicly accessible markets use a central limit&nbsp;order book&nbsp;style of exchange, where buyers and sellers create orders organized by price level that are progressively filled as demand shifts. Anyone who has traded stocks through brokerage firms will be familiar with an order book system.</p>

<p>The Uniswap protocol takes a different approach, using an Automated Market Maker (AMM), sometimes referred to as a Constant Function Market Maker, in place of an order book.</p>

<p>At a very high level, an AMM replaces the buy and sell orders in an order book market with a liquidity pool of two assets, both valued relative to each other. As one asset is traded for the other, the relative prices of the two assets shift, and a new market rate for both is determined. In this dynamic, a buyer or seller trades directly with the pool, rather than with specific orders left by other parties. The advantages and disadvantages of Automated Market Makers versus their traditional order book counterparts are under active research by a growing number of parties. The second departure from traditional markets is the permissionless and immutable design of the Uniswap protocol. These design decisions were inspired by Ethereum&#39;s core tenets. Permissionless design means that the protocol&#39;s services are entirely open for public use, with no ability to selectively restrict who can or cannot use them. Anyone can swap, provide liquidity, or create new markets at will. This is a departure from traditional financial services, which typically restrict access based on geography, wealth status, and age. The protocol is also immutable, in other words not upgradeable. No party is able to pause the contracts, reverse trade execution, or otherwise change the behaviour of the protocol in any way. It is worth noting that Uniswap Governance has the right (but no obligation) to divert a percentage of swap fees on any pool to a specified address. However, this capability is known to all participants in advance, and to prevent abuse, the percentage is constrained between 10% and 25%.</p>

<p>3.3 Architecture/Framework:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This system uses Solidity for establishing the smart contracts necessary for the transactions. Solidity&nbsp;is an&nbsp;object-oriented programming language&nbsp;for implementing&nbsp;smart contracts<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity#cite_note-2">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity#cite_note-finextra24Nov2016-3">[3]</a>&nbsp;on various&nbsp;blockchain&nbsp;platforms, most notably,&nbsp;Ethereum. It was developed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, and several former&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;core contributors.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity#cite_note-5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Programs in Solidity run on&nbsp;Ethereum Virtual Machine. Moralis for the Backend and Node.js. The proposed system also uses Tailwind CSS for the Frontend and also React.js. The project is hosted on Amazon Web Services using the S3, EC2 and Route 53 services. <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nmTD8Uwb35JbyEtb0emCE-zEx7qaOYvihC_zTW09_H-tUrojo3mNKxKRsY9W-KzLqb8uEAFNrLRbJVbPVWA85GI6n7nWFG2F3xFnG917Mas8pDyq1_Y_GydbwGnNOLGmTkoXW2KvL5FZcExow3dbXJ9WoKg3CiWhkLAKTscBCJBIPeZ3eyH3MdTyA2LNjSvH1bSxF24y_A" style="height:324px; width:594px" /></p>

<p>3.3.1 Amazon Web Services: (AWS) is a subsidiary of&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;that provides&nbsp;on-demand&nbsp;cloud computing&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;and&nbsp;APIs&nbsp;to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing&nbsp;web services&nbsp;provide&nbsp;distributed computing&nbsp;processing capacity and software tools via AWS&nbsp;server farms. One of these services is&nbsp;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud&nbsp;(EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a&nbsp;virtual&nbsp;cluster of computers, available all the time, through the Internet. AWS&#39;s virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware&nbsp;central processing units&nbsp;(CPUs) and&nbsp;graphics processing units&nbsp;(GPUs) for processing; local/RAM&nbsp;memory; hard-disk/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as&nbsp;web servers,&nbsp;databases, and&nbsp;customer relationship management&nbsp;(CRM).</p>

<p>AWS services are delivered to customers via a network of AWS server farms located throughout the world. Fees are based on a combination of usage (known as a &quot;Pay-as-you-go&quot; model), hardware, operating system, software, or networking features chosen by the subscriber required&nbsp;availability,&nbsp;redundancy,&nbsp;security, and service options. Subscribers can pay for a single virtual AWS computer, a dedicated physical computer, or clusters of either. Amazon provides select portions of security for subscribers (e.g., physical security of the data centres) while other aspects of security are the responsibility of the subscriber (e.g., account management, vulnerability scanning, patching). AWS operates from many global geographical regions including 6 in North America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.3.2 Cloud computing: Meanwhile, cloud computing is the on-demand availability of&nbsp;computer&nbsp;system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and&nbsp;computing power, without direct active management by the user.&nbsp;Large clouds often have functions&nbsp;distributed&nbsp;over multiple locations, each of which is a&nbsp;data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically uses a &quot;pay as you go&quot; model, which can help in reducing&nbsp;capital expenses&nbsp;but may also lead to unexpected&nbsp;operating expenses&nbsp;for users.</p>

<h3>Web 1.0&nbsp;and&nbsp;Web 2.0&nbsp;refer to eras in the&nbsp;history of the World Wide Web&nbsp;as it evolved through various technologies and formats. Web 1.0 refers roughly to the period from 1991 to 2004, where most sites consisted of&nbsp;static pages, and the vast majority of users were consumers, not producers, of content.&nbsp;Web 2.0 is based around the idea of &quot;the web as platform&quot; and centres on user-created content uploaded to&nbsp;forums,&nbsp;social media&nbsp;and networking services,&nbsp;blogs, and&nbsp;wikis, among other services.&nbsp;Web 2.0 is generally considered to have begun around 2004 and continues to the current day.&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>3.5.2 Web3:&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Web3&nbsp;(also known as&nbsp;Web 3.0) is an idea for a new iteration of the&nbsp;World Wide Web&nbsp;which incorporates concepts such as&nbsp;decentralization,&nbsp;blockchain technologies, and token-based economics.&nbsp;Some technologists and journalists have contrasted it with&nbsp;Web 2.0, wherein they say data and content are centralized in a small group of companies sometimes referred to as &quot;Big Tech&quot;. The term &quot;Web3&quot; was coined in 2014 by&nbsp;Ethereum&nbsp;co-founder&nbsp;Gavin Wood, and the idea gained interest in 2021 from&nbsp;cryptocurrency&nbsp;enthusiasts, large technology companies, and&nbsp;venture capital&nbsp;firms.&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Some commentators argue that Web3 will provide increased&nbsp;data security,&nbsp;scalability, and&nbsp;privacy&nbsp;for users and combat the influence of large technology companies. <img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_rxSZZd42vAGwwh4Kbz-c1vIJtJNUxpdQWPA9RE83vwht_hynKVLEoa7Upa0JJQFEXjQqYgEkQI7oB-6JhE1H5MFnldx7Oyf8HfKYzGs9tc_8sULPg5XSCi9B1yLYvWZwvLqMEC6pJVOHG_2vtY4TCEDbt4u451GZpPwrZnKFCRxFq4jXIKGR8ofAZ7PL5NvXpUtBc4_jw" style="height:500px; width:500px" /></h3>
